Analog Colours is a tribute to the classic sounds of Moog, Roland, Korg, and other legendary synth makers. You will find bells, flutes, guitars, keys, leads, pads, plucks, synths, and more in this pack. Each preset has been carefully crafted and tweaked to give you a unique and inspiring sound.
 
One of the best features of Analog Colours is that it uses Omnisphere's powerful engine to create realistic and organic sounds. You can easily manipulate the presets with Omnisphere's modulation options, effects, and arpeggiators. You can also layer them with other sounds to create your own custom patches.
 
Analog Colours is compatible with Omnisphere 2.6 and above. You can download it from ProdbyJack's website or from Plugs-X. The price is very affordable and you will get a lot of value for your money. If you are looking for some fresh and vintage sounds for your Omnisphere library, you should definitely give Analog Colours a try.
  
In this section, we will review some of the presets in Analog Colours and show you how they sound and what you can do with them. We will also compare them with some of the factory presets in Omnisphere and see how they stand out.
 
One of the presets that caught our attention was the "Analog Flute". This preset sounds like a real flute that has been processed with some analog effects. It has a warm and airy tone that can add some organic flavor to your tracks. You can use it for melodies, chords, or background textures. You can also adjust the filter, envelope, and vibrato to change the character of the sound.
 
Another preset that we liked was the "Analog Guitar". This preset sounds like a clean electric guitar that has been recorded through an old tape machine. It has a crisp and bright sound that can cut through the mix. You can use it for riffs, leads, or arpeggios. You can also tweak the drive, chorus, and delay to add some more depth and movement to the sound.
 
A third preset that we enjoyed was the "Analog Pad". This preset sounds like a lush and warm analog synth pad that has been layered with some strings and choir samples. It has a rich and spacious sound that can fill up the sonic space. You can use it for chords, pads, or drones. You can also modify the cutoff, resonance, and reverb to change the mood and atmosphere of the sound.
 
As you can see, Analog Colours offers a lot of variety and quality in its presets. They are not just simple copies of analog synths, but rather creative and original sounds that have been inspired by them. They also sound different from the factory presets in Omnisphere, which tend to be more digital and futuristic. Analog Colours gives you a more vintage and nostalgic vibe that can suit many genres and styles.
